		        Whales are some of the largest living animals. They
		        live in the ocean, having fully adapted to living
		        in the water.  They are mammals!

		        Sharks are known for being apex predators, but some
		        sharks only eat small fish.  Sharks teeth never stop
		        growing, with old ones constantly falling out and 
		        being replaced by new teeth.

		        Dolphins are highly intelligent animals, demonstrated by their
		        curiosity and complex social structure.  Although they
		        live in the ocean, they breathe air. Lucky for them, they
		        can hold their breath for up to 15 minutes.

		        Octopuses are also very intelligent animals.  There are several
		        cases of octopuses escaping from aquariums.  They are able
		        to change the color and even the texture of their skin at will!
